<font color="white" aling="center">DataView. A dataview is a view on a datatable, a bit like a sql view.<br>
It allows you to filter and sort the rows - often for binding to a windows form control.<br>
Additionally, a DataView can be customized to present a subset of data from the DataTable.</font>
